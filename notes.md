# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains the solutions to the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures projects, which are part of the FreeCodeCamp certification course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

## Projects

The following are the five projects included in this repository:

1. Palindrome Checker
2. Roman Numeral Converter
3. Caesars Cipher
4. Telephone Number Validator
5. Cash Register

Each project focuses on different aspects of JavaScript algorithms and data structures. They are designed to challenge your problem-solving skills and test your understanding of JavaScript concepts.

## Project Descriptions

### Palindrome Checker

This project involves writing a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. The function should return `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

### Roman Numeral Converter

The Roman Numeral Converter project requires you to write a function that converts a given decimal number to its Roman numeral equivalent.

### Caesars Cipher

In the Caesars Cipher project, you will implement a function that takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

### Telephone Number Validator

The Telephone Number Validator project involves writing a function that validates whether a given string represents a valid US phone number.

### Cash Register

The Cash Register project is more advanced and simulates the functionality of a cash register. You will need to implement a function that takes a purchase price, payment amount, and an array of cash-in-drawer values. The function should calculate the change to be returned and provide the appropriate denominations from the cash drawer.
